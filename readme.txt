New in 1.2
Reserve driver list in two collums !
You need to set ReserveDriverMax to : (Number of reserve driver /2 round it up to next even number)

ex you have 5 reserve drivers so Reserve Driver Max will be 3

----------------------------------------------------------
V1.0

This theme is based on the defaut theme with a complete new line-up, everything can be translate in other language just by
adding a new json file in localizations directory i have include a french (Canadian) version already

****
I use Real Name, Name field and Race Number in the database 

Use Real name as Firstname and Name as LastName

So Real name = Max  **use a space at the end 
and Name = Verstapen 

Options: 
Render Reserve drivers : if you want to render your reserve driver just toggle this option !

Thanks to 

Sirotkin for making this !
