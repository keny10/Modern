    "PurePaceDescription":"Pure laptime - it's combined time of the best sectors in the race. Each sector (S1, S2, S3) is processing independently,\n30% of the best race sectors of each driver are fully taken into account. The influence of the next 30% on the final result\ndecreases linearly to 0. Only drivers who have driven at least 60% of the race distance are counted.\n\nTyres usage - is the percentage of tyres that have shown sector times that were used in the pure laptime calculation.\n\n\n\nSector performance - it is the efficiency of driving sectors for each driver relative to others. 10 - equals that only driver showed\nall the best sectors. 5 - equals that driver show time corresponding the total average time for all drivers who participate in the rating.\nDuring processing the race distance is divided into 3 segments, and each segment is processed independently, the final result is the\nweighted average of all segments."
